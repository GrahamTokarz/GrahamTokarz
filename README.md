ML 4641 Team 18 Project

Directories:<br>
`/ML Models/`: The location of our trained models, as well as the relevant datasets.<br>
`/ML Models/Dataset_Signature_Final/`: The dataset used by our random forest and SVM models. This folder should be simply placed in the same directory as these models for them to run properly.<br>
`/ML Models/CNN/`: A sub-folder exclusively for our CNN model, as it uses a slightly modified dataset.<br>
`/ML Models/CNN/test-20240724T213240Z-001/`: A directory that houses our test images for our CNN model.<br>
`/ML Models/CNN/train-20240724T213234Z-001/`: A directory that houses our training images for our CNN model.<br>
`/Report Documents/`: A directory that houses the images and scripts needed to display our report on GitHub Pages.<br>
<br>
Files:<br>
`/Ml Models/SVM.ipynb`: A jupyter notebook that holds our SVM model.<br>
`/Ml Models/Random forest.ipynb`: A jupyter notebook that holds our random forest model.<br>
`/Ml Models/CNN/CNN.ipynb`: A jupyter notebook that holds our CNN model.<br>
`/Report Documents/report.js`: A simple js script that allows for version switching between the different deliverables for our project report.<br>
