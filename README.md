ML 4641 Team 18 Project

Directories:
/ML Models/: The location of our trained models, as well as the relevant datasets.
/ML Models/Dataset_Signature_Final/: The dataset used by our random forest and SVM models. This folder should be simply placed in the same directory as these models for them to run properly.
/ML Models/CNN/: A sub-folder exclusively for our CNN model, as it uses a slightly modified dataset.
/ML Models/CNN/test-20240724T213240Z-001/: A directory that houses our test images for our CNN model.
/ML Models/CNN/train-20240724T213234Z-001/: A directory that houses our training images for our CNN model.
/Report Documents/: A directory that houses the images and scripts needed to display our report on GitHub Pages.

Files:
/Ml Models/SVM.ipynb: A jupyter notebook that holds our SVM model.
/Ml Models/Random forest.ipynb: A jupyter notebook that holds our random forest model.
/Ml Models/CNN/CNN.ipynb: A jupyter notebook that holds our CNN model.
/Report Documents/report.js: A simple js script that allows for version switching between the different deliverables for our project report.
