            <h1>Proposal: Machine Learning for Signature Verification</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Introduction / Background</h2>
            <p>
                Signature forgery is a widespread issue impacting banking, legal, and business sectors.
                Forged signatures can lead to unauthorized access, fraudulent transactions, and significant
                financial losses. Businesses, in particular, can suffer from fraudulent contracts and
                unauthorized transactions, impacting their credibility and operational efficiency. Individuals
                can also experience significant financial loss when forgers steal money from their accounts
                or engage in fraudulent transactions using their forged signatures. Manual detection is
                labor-intensive and prone to errors, necessitating an automated and reliable method for
                verification.
            </p>
            <h3>Literature Review</h3>
            <p>
                Several studies have explored signature verification using machine learning. For example,
                Poddar et al. (2020) proposed a method for signature recognition and forgery detection
                using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the Crest-Trough method, and the SURF
                algorithm. They achieved an accuracy of 85-89% for forgery detection and 90-94% for
                signature recognition. Another study by Justino et al. (2004) evaluated different learning
                strategies and classification methods for offline signature verification. They found that
                support vector machines (SVM) outperformed other methods in scenarios involving
                forgeries. A systematic review by Abdelrahman et al (2021) highlighted the effectiveness of
                deep learning-based models for offline signature verification, consolidating performances
                across various public datasets.
            </p>
            <h3>Dataset Description</h3>
            <p>
                The dataset consists of images of signatures from 30 individuals, each with 5 genuine and 5
                forged signatures. The images are named in a way that differentiates between genuine and
                forged signatures.

            <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
                The primary problem is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish
                between genuine and forged signatures.
            </p>
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                Signature verification is important for preventing fraud and ensuring the authenticity of
                documents. An automated system can significantly reduce the time and effort required for
                manual verification while also increasing accuracy and reliability.
